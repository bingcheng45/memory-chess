## Responsive Design Plan for Small Screens (iPhone SE)

### Current Issues
- Game board may not fit on small screens without scrolling
- UI elements like controls and stats may take up too much vertical space
- Chess pieces may be difficult to manipulate on small touch screens
- Text and buttons may be too small or too large on different devices

### Responsive Design Strategy

#### 1. Dynamic Board Sizing
- Implement a responsive chess board that automatically resizes based on screen dimensions
- Calculate optimal board size based on viewport height and width
- Ensure board fits entirely within the viewport without scrolling
- Adjust coordinate labels to remain visible but compact on small screens

#### 2. Responsive Layout Structure
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for fluid layouts
- Create collapsible sections for game controls and settings
- Implement priority-based rendering for critical UI elements
- Use CSS media queries specifically targeting smaller screens (iPhone SE is 320x568px)

#### 3. Optimized Touch Interaction
- Increase touch target sizes for chess pieces on small screens
- Implement intuitive drag and drop for piece movement
- Add visual feedback for touch interactions
- Create zoom or magnification options for precise piece placement

#### 4. Compact UI Components
- Design collapsible panels for secondary information
- Use icons instead of text where appropriate
- Implement swipeable interfaces for multi-step processes
- Create a minimalistic view option for gameplay

#### 5. Implementation Plan
1. Add viewport-based calculations for chess board sizing
2. Refactor ChessBoard.tsx to be fully responsive
3. Update Game components to use relative sizing
4. Implement layout changes based on screen breakpoints
5. Create compact versions of GameControls and GameStats
6. Test on iPhone SE and other small devices
7. Optimize touch interactions for small screens
