# Memory Chess - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
Memory Chess is a web-based memory game that challenges players to memorize and recreate randomized chess positions. The game combines chess visualization with memory skills, offering a unique and engaging experience for chess enthusiasts and casual players alike.

## Core Gameplay
Memory Chess follows a simple yet challenging gameplay loop:

1. **Memorization Phase**: Players are shown a randomly generated chess position with a specific number of pieces for a limited time. These positions are not standard starting positions but rather unique arrangements of pieces that the player needs to mentally register - including the types of pieces and their exact locations on the board.

2. **Solution Phase**: After the memorization time expires, the pieces disappear, and players must recreate the position from memory by placing the correct pieces on the correct squares.

3. **Accuracy Assessment**: The game evaluates how accurately the player recreated the position, calculating a score based on correct piece placements.

4. **Progressive Difficulty**: As players improve, the game increases in difficulty by:
   - Increasing the number of pieces to memorize
   - Reducing the memorization time
   - Using more complex piece arrangements

5. **Skill Rating System**: Players earn a skill rating that evolves based on their performance, creating a sense of progression and achievement.

6. **Daily Challenges**: Special curated positions that provide a consistent challenge and encourage regular practice.

The randomized positions make each memory challenge unique and prevent players from relying on familiarity with standard chess positions, focusing the gameplay purely on memory and visualization skills.
