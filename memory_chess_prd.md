# Memory Chess - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Memory Chess is a web-based cognitive training game that challenges players to memorize and recreate randomly generated chess positions. The game is designed to improve memory, spatial awareness, and chess visualization skills through progressive difficulty levels and performance tracking.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Memorization Phase âœ…
1. Players are presented with a chess board containing a random arrangement of pieces
2. A countdown timer (adjustable from 5-30 seconds) shows remaining memorization time
3. Players must mentally record the position of all pieces on the board
4. Visual cues and sound effects mark the beginning and end of the memorization phase

### Solution Phase âœ…
1. Players are presented with an empty chess board
2. Using drag-and-drop or click selection, players recreate the position from memory
3. A piece palette is available with all standard chess pieces
4. Players can reset their solution or submit when ready
5. No time limit is enforced during the solution phase

### Accuracy Assessment âœ…
1. The system compares the player's solution to the original position
2. An accuracy score (0-100%) is calculated based on correct piece placement
3. Visual feedback highlights correct and incorrect placements
4. A detailed breakdown shows which pieces were placed correctly
5. Performance metrics are recorded for progression tracking

### Progressive Difficulty âœ…
1. Difficulty increases based on player performance
2. Variables affecting difficulty:
   - Number of pieces on the board (3-32)
   - Memorization time (5-30 seconds)
   - Position complexity (random vs. game-like positions)
3. A skill rating system tracks player improvement over time
4. Adaptive difficulty ensures appropriate challenge level
