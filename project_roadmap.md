## Next Steps
1. Begin with Phase 1.1: Development Environment Setup
2. Set up Supabase project and database schema
3. Create basic project structure
4. Start implementing core game components

## Notes
- Estimates assume full-time development
- Some tasks can be worked on in parallel
- Timeline may vary based on team size and experience
- Regular testing and review cycles should be included
- Additional features from PRD can be added in future iterations
