# Memory Chess - Implementation Roadmap

## Core Gameplay Overview
Memory Chess challenges players to memorize and recreate randomly generated chess positions. The core gameplay loop consists of:
1. **Memorization Phase**: Players view a randomly generated chess position for a limited time
2. **Solution Phase**: Players recreate the position from memory
3. **Accuracy Assessment**: The game evaluates the player's accuracy
4. **Progression**: Difficulty increases as players improve

The randomized position generation is a critical component that ensures each game provides a unique challenge and prevents players from relying on familiarity with standard chess positions.

## Current Focus: Bug Fixes and UI Standardization
